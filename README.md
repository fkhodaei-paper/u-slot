# A Probe-fed U-slot Patch Antenna With Suspended Microstrip Configuration

Abstract- In this paper, a probe-fed u-slot patch antenna in a suspended microstrip configuration is presented. The effects of parameters of suspended structure on the antenna response have been investigated. It is shown that the use of suspended configuration in this antenna improves its response. Also the suspended configuration has made the fabrication of the antenna easier than the case in which the complete Foam material is used for substrate.
